# Snail Game

### to start playing just clone the repo and be sure u have GCC installed on your machine, then you can run in project root dir
```
make
```

this will create snail file and you can just run it from project root directory

```
./snail
```

### technical stuff
this game uses <u>TERMIOS</u> so it might not work for systems other than UNIX like windows. I haven't really tested it on macbook (couse I dont have one) but it's UNIX so I think it would work for it
